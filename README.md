# RUCropViewController

RUCropViewController is an open-source `UIViewController` subclass built to allow users to perform basic manipulation on `UIImage` objects; specifically cropping and some basic rotations. It has been designed with the iOS 8 Photos app in mind, and as such, behaves in an already familiar way.

This project was inspired by [TOCropController](https://github.com/TimOliver/TOCropViewController)

## Features
* Crop images by dragging the edges of a grid overlay.
* Optionally, crop circular copies of images.
* Rotate images in 90-degree segments.
* Clamp the crop box to a specific aspect ratio.
* A reset button to completely undo all changes.
