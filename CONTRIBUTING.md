# Contributing to `RUCropViewController`

Thanks so much for your interest in `RUCropViewController`! I'm really happy, that you want to help us to translate it to swifty :)

## Submitting a Pull Request
Right now, the main goal is pretty straingtforward, we need to translate everything in swift and, later on, make a full refactor of the project.

We have opened a couple of issues, they are pretty big, but if you know objective-c, it's more time-consuming, than really difficult.
